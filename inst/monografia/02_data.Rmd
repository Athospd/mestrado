# The Data {.chapter}

## Training/Testing data

Two main data sources with almost ready to use labels were gathered:

- [Xeno-Canto.org](Xeno-Canto.org)
- [Wikiaves.com.br](https://www.wikiaves.com.br/)

Those websites are the biggest repository of Brazilian bird species sounds. The table \@ref(tab:mp3-counts) show the counts of MP3 downloaded by species.

```{r mp3-counts}
library(magrittr)
data.frame(Species = list.files("../../data-raw/wav_16khz/") %>%
             stringr::str_remove_all("[.0-9]|(wav)") %>%
             stringr::str_remove_all("-$")
) %>%
  dplyr::count(Species, name = "#mp3", sort = TRUE) %>%
  janitor::adorn_totals() %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "MP3 files downloaded.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 12) %>%
  kableExtra::row_spec(6, bold = TRUE)
```

No providence was made if the same audio happened to appear at both sources.

The {warbleR} [@warbleR2017] and {wikiaves} [@R-wikiaves] packages were used to retrieve all the mp3 available automatically. A tutorial to reproduce the extraction can be found in this link [https://athospd.github.io/mestrado/articles/data-gathering.html]().
